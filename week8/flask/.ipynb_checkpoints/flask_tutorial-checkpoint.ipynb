    "Flask is a micro web framework powered by Python. Micro-frameworks are normally frameworks with little to no dependencies to external libraries. This makes Flask fairly small, making it easy to learn and simple to use. But also powerful enough to support enterprise-level applications handling large amounts of traffic. Flask was created by Armin Ronacher: \"It came out of an April Fool's joke but proved popular enough to make into a serious application in its own right.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: \n",
    "- the framework is light\n",
    "- there are little dependencies to update\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- as your apps needs grow your list of dependencies will grow\n",
    "- you will have to do a lot more work by yourself"
